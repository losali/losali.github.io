        <a href="mailto:president@fsu.edu, bbowden@fsu.edu, fsusgapresident@admin.fsu.edu, ahecht@fsu.edu?subject=Supporting Black and brown students at FSU &body=I am emailing as a concerned member of the Florida State University community. I am concerned with the vague response of the FSU Administration concerning the demands of their Black and brown students and their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. I demand a stronger response from the university with real plans and goals rather than platitudes about inclusivity. I want a swift declaration of solidarity with Black and brown students of FSU that includes a promise to remove the Eppes statue and to rename the Eppes Building, BK Roberts Hall and Doak Campbell Stadium. If FSU is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for all, that must include Black and brown students as well.">Click Here to Send Email to FSU</a>
